## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to predict user churn for Sparkify, a digital music service. Churn prediction is critical to reducing customer attrition, enabling Sparkify to take targeted actions to retain at-risk users. Using a smaller subset of the data in this workspace and Spark for processing, this project will build a model to predict churn by analyzing user activity patterns.

**Getting Started:** To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Load and Clean Dataset: Start by loading the dataset (mini_sparkify_event_data.json) and perform basic data cleaning operations to handle missing or invalid data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand user behavior, session activity, and other relevant patterns in the data.

- Define Churn: Define churn based on specific events, such as "Cancellation Confirmation," to create a label for our predictive model.

- Explore Data: Explore the data further to observe differences in behavior between users who churned and those who stayed.

- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset to train our predictive model. Ensure scalability and adherence to best practices in feature engineering.

- Modeling: Split the dataset into train, test, and validation sets. Test various machine learning methods, evaluate model performance, and optimize based on metrics such as F1 score.

**Files in the Repository**

- mini_sparkify_event_data.json: The dataset containing user interactions with the Sparkify platform.
- Sparkify.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
- Sparkify_blog.md: This file, providing how we can leverage the Sparkify dataset to analyze user behavior and predict churn using Apache Spark.

**Libraries Used**
- pyspark
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

To run the code in Sparkify.ipynb, you need to set up a Spark cluster environment. If you're using this workspace, Spark is already configured.

Open Sparkify.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook cells to execute each step of the analysis.

Ensure all dependencies are installed (Apache Spark, PySpark, etc.) to run the code successfully.

**Conclusion**

By analyzing user behavior and predicting churn, this project aims to provide valuable insights for businesses like Sparkify. Through data-driven decision-making, companies can optimize user retention strategies and enhance overall customer experience.
